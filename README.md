Wow. Okay, so just walked out of O'Dessa and my head is still swimming. First, why is it SO loud in theaters? My ears are still ringing and I have this vision of popcorn bits trailing out behind me like bread crumbs in the forest. And that movie...it was like my imagination ate a salad of neon colors topped with flaming croutons of insanity. 

There was this one scene, right, where the protagonist, Maria, was standing in a field of flowers. –Her expression was like a llama who had just realized it was a cow all along?– Gosh, I hope that makes sense. My back's killing me and these theater seats might as well be medieval torture devices, but whatever, I'd sit through it again.

> Suddenly remembered, you HAVE to download the movie, yes, or watch the movie with people who don't mind subtitles that glow like glowworms on a mission to blind you. Are subtitles getting flashier or is it just me?? 

One woozy kaleidoscope moment, when the city morphed into an ocean of lavender, yeah i think my heart did a little dance, like maybe the cha-cha or stumbling toddler. At that point, it felt like my brain was chewing on bubblegum and maybe mixing mint chocolate chip? Not sure what it means, but the colors were singing. Actual synesthetic wonderland. My phone’s buzzing, so much noise – wait – the villain's monologue was like listening to my neighbor drone on about his petunias but with dragons. Less coherent though. 

Sorry, I know Sarah asked me to watch it and explain, but honestly Sarah, what were YOU thinking? Download the movie would ya? If Salvador Dali went through a car wash and painted that experience, he'd still be lagging behind this film's visual weirdness.

Also, my right shoe feels tighter. Does a movie do that somehow? Can it conk your fashion sense upside the head with its awesomeness? Julia's pink dress was like if a cherry blossom had a lovechild with a traffic cone. I mean, who even thinks of that? The filmmaker was on a different planet, possibly orbiting a disco ball.
